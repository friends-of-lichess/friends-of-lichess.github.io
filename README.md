# Friends of Lichess website

**[https://www.friendsoflichess.org](https://www.friendsoflichess.org)**

- Pushes to `main` trigger immediate site build and deploy (so be careful :-)) 
- PRs and edits gratefully accepted.
- Rollback is easiest by reverting, however the workflow can be [triggered manually](https://github.com/friends-of-lichess/friends-of-lichess.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yml) to push a different branch or tag.
- Test locally with `hugo serve` ([docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/))
